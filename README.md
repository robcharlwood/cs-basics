# CS Basics

A repository containing basic Python implementations of computer science fundamentals, including data structures and sorting algorithms. This is mainly just somewhere I can mind dump this stuff as I play with it, but I am open sourcing it as others may also find it useful. :)

If there is enough interest, I may also release some helpful tutorials along with my scrappy notes. :)
